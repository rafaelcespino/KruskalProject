# KruskalProject
 
The purpose of this academic project was to calculate the shortest route between all cities listed in the CSV file. The CSV file contains the available flights between each pair of cities and the distance between those routes. Using Kruskal's algorithm and disjoint sets, the program was able to calculate the minimum spanning tree. Created for an assignment for the Data Structures and Algorithms course.
